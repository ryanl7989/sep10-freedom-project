# My Tool

This blog is going to be about my tool and how I tinkered with it. The tool that I chose is Sass. I tinkered with Sass by trying its different features like variables, nesting, and mixins. One way I tinkered was by following and trying things in videos that I saw. For example, one video that I found useful for Sass is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&ab_channel=CoderCoder">this</a>. I followed her video as I tinkered with my code based on what I saw her do. I also looked at websites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sass/sass_mixin_include.php">this</a> when I didn't understand what I saw in the video to get a better understanding of what the code did.

# Engineering Design Process

Previously I was on the third step of the engineering design process, which was brainstorming for future technology in architecture. Now I am on the fourth step, which is planning. I am planning by picking and testing a tool to use for my freedom project, which can help me plan out how I want my website to look. Next I am going to make a prototype to see what I need more of.

# Skills
A few skills that I have improved on by tinkering my tool are **how to read** and **attention to detail**

### How to read

I feel like I have gotten better at how to read because when I was looking through different websites searching for what a piece of code did, I ended up finding lots of information that I did not ask for. I had to skim through most of the information to find what I needed.

### Attention to detail

I think that I am growing in attention to detail because when I was tinkering and I made a typo in something like a variable, a big group of elements would stop working and confuse me, making me have to look back into my code and find the error. Later on, though, I felt myself making fewer mistakes in typos, making it easier to code.
