Some skills that I have learned while doing researching my topic was **How to Google** and **How to read**.

## How to google
I think that I have gotten better on how to google because while I was searching for technology that is used in architecture I tried searching "architectural technology" but I couldn't find anything about what items they use but when I made a similar search "architecture gadgets" I found the information that I needed.
##How to read
I also feel like I have gotten better at how to read because I had to do a lot of research on techonology that architects use and now I understand how they work and what they do.
