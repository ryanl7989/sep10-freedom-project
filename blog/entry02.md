# Context
In my last entry I was figuring out what topic my project was going to be about. For this blog I reserched what technology is used in architecture. Some examples of these technology are a 3D scanner that analyzes a real world object or environment to collect data of its shape and its appearance. Another example is a laser measurer that is used to measure a space which is good for smaller projects when the 3D scanner takes too much time to set up, a laser cutter that cuts things to create items or products, and a adjustable desk that can be adjusted to if you want to stand or sit.
# Engineering Design Process
I am between the second and third step of the engineering design process. I have finished researching the information for my topic. Next I am going to brainstorm the possible solutions. For the next step I am going to barainstorm about how techonology can used in architecture.

# Skills
Some skills that I have learned while doing researching my topic was **How to Google** and **How to read**.

## How to google
I think that I have gotten better on how to google because while I was searching for technology that is used in architecture I tried searching "architectural technology" but I couldn't find anything about what items they use but when I made a similar search "architecture gadgets" I found the information that I needed.

## How to read
I also feel like I have gotten better at how to read because I had to do a lot of research on techonology that architects use and now I understand how they work and what they do.
