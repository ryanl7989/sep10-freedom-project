### Context

In my last blog entry I was researching about existing techonology in architecture. This blog is going to be about the ideas that I have for the future. A few examples of this are a giant holographic room and an app that has ai that will make the changes to your architecture designs based on what you tell it to do. Some details for the holographic room are:

* You can interact with the hologram in any way you like and use different tools to change certain things.
* It can store memory of what you change and can save at certain times on your computer.
* You can send and receive information to anyone you like.
* There is a website or app where you can send your ideas to and look at other peopleâ€™s ideas.
* Cameras around the room to show the hologram and track where you are.
My ideas for the app are:
* You can save and edit muliple projects at a time.
* You can test it in a test mode that will not change your real project but you can decide if you want to change it.
* You can invite other poeple to help you in your projects.
