### Context

In my last blog entry I was researching about existing techonology in architecture. This blog is going to be about the ideas that I have for the future. A few examples of this are a giant holographic room and an app that has ai that will make the changes to your architecture designs based on what you tell it to do. Some details for the holographic room are:

* You can interact with the hologram in any way you like and use different tools to change certain things.
* It can store memory of what you change and can save at certain times on your computer.
* You can send and receive information to anyone you like.
* There is a website or app where you can send your ideas to and look at other peopleâ€™s ideas.
* Cameras around the room to show the hologram and track where you are.

My ideas for the app are:

* You can save and edit multiple projects at a time.
* You can test it in a test mode that will not change your real project but you can decide if you want to change it.
* You can invite other people to help you in your projects.
* You can also make changes on your own.
* Has a system like github where you can push and pull changes.

### Engineering Design Process

I am currently between the third and fourth step of the engineering design process. I have already finished researching for exisiting arhictecture techology including the hardware and software. I am still brainstorming for nonexistent ideas using inspiration from older SEP10 freedom projects and by talking to my classmates that have similar topics as me. Soon I am going move onto the fourth step and make a plan.

### Skills

Some skills that I have learned include Communication and Creativity

* Communication: I have talked with people who have similar topics as me and used their feedback to think of new ideas that I can use.
* Creativity: I have been think of what new inovations I can add which had caused me to think outside the box and look at things in new ways.
