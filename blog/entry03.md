### Context

In my last blog entry I was researching about existing techonology in architecture. This blog is going to be about the ideas that I have for the future. A few examples of this are a giant holographic room and an app that has ai that will make the changes to your architecture designs based on what you tell it to do. Some details for the holographic room are:

* You can interact with the hologram in any way you like and use different tools to change certain things.
* It can store memory of what you change and can save at certain times on your computer.
* You can send and receive information to anyone you like.
* There is a website where you can send your ideas to and look at other peopleâ€™s ideas.
* Cameras around the room to show the hologram and track where you are.
