<h1>My Topic</h1>
The topic I have decided on is Archtecture because my parents signed me and my brother up for a archeture camp and I liked it a lot and I want to learn more about it. My backup ideas were gambling and medicine because my dad owed a gambling school and I thought it was interesting and my parents want me to become a doctor. Some links that I used are https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/technology-architecture by autodesk and https://www.archdaily.com/1000647/what-is-architectural-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-industry by archdaily. The first link showed my multiple examples of technology in archetcture and what they do. The second link taught me what Architectural Technology and how they are used in the world. These two links showed me what archeteture is, how it works, and how to use it.
<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
I am on the first step of the engineering design process, which is defining. First I find what I want to use for my project. The next step is research where I am going to research about archetecture and find out more about it. Then I well research about how technology is used in archtecture and how it affects people. Some examples of how technology is used in archtecture are AR, Artifical intelegence, and BIM.
<h1>Skills</h1>
Some of the skills that I have learned from researching this topic are Time management and Focusing
<h3>Time management</h3>
Outside of school I have a few things that I have to do like playing Volleyball and going to stength and conditioning club. I also have been getting more work as the school year has gone on so I have had to cut back on going to stength and conditioning somedays and have been focusing on doing work which will help me focus on finishing my work first.
<h3>Focusing</h3>
Focusing is an important skill that I have gotten. I usualy get sidetracked while doing things like homework and start playing games leaving me with lots of missing or incomplete work. Instead now I put music on and try to stop myself from being distracted which has improved my work ethic. When my firends call I tell them that I have to finnish my work before playing with them instead of stopping what I was doing to play video games.
