<h1>My Topic</h1>
The topic I have decided on is Architecture because my parents signed me and my brother up for an architecture camp and I liked it a lot and I want to learn more about it. My backup ideas were gambling and medicine because my dad owned a gambling school, and I thought it was interesting, and my parents want me to become a doctor. Some links that I used are https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/technology-architecture by Autodesk and https://www.archdaily.com/1000647/what-is-architectural-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-industry by ArchDaily. The first link showed me multiple examples of technology in architecture and what they do. The second link taught me what Architectural Technology is and how it is used in the world. These two links showed me what architecture is, how it works, and how to use it.
<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
I am on the first step of the engineering design process, which is defining. First, I find what I want to use for my project. The next step is research where I am going to research architecture and find out more about it. Then I will research how technology is used in architecture and how it affects people. Some examples of how technology is used in architecture are AR, Artificial intelligence, and BIM.
<h1>Skills</h1>
Some of the skills that I have learned from researching this topic are Time management and Focusing.
<h3>Time management</h3>
Outside of school, I have a few things that I have to do like playing Volleyball and going to strength and conditioning club. I have also been getting more work as the school year has gone on, so I have had to cut back on going to strength and conditioning some days and have been focusing on doing work which will help me focus on finishing my work first.
<h3>Focusing</h3>
Focusing is an important skill that I have acquired. I usually get sidetracked while doing things like homework and start playing games, leaving me with lots of missing or incomplete work. Instead, now I put music on and try to stop myself from being distracted which has improved my work ethic. When my friends call, I tell them that I have to finish my work before playing with them instead of stopping what I was doing to play video games.
<h1>Summary</h1>
I am excited to learn and research more about using technology in architecture<br>
