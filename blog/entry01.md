<h1>My Topic</h1>
The topic I have decided on is Archtecture because my parents signed me and my brother up for a archeture camp and I liked it a lot and I want to learn more about it. My backup ideas were gambling and medicine because my dad owed a gambling school and I thought it was interesting and my parents want me to become a doctor. Some links that I used are https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/technology-architecture by autodesk and https://www.archdaily.com/1000647/what-is-architectural-technology-how-technology-is-changing-the-industry by archdaily. The first link showed my multiple examples of technology in archetcture and what they do. The second link taught me what Architectural Technology and how they are used in the world. These two links showed me what archeteture is, how it works, and how to use it.
<h1>Engineering Design Process</h1>
I am on the first step of the engineering design process, which is defining. First I find what I want to use for my project. The next step is research where I am going to research about archetecture and find out more about it. Then I well research about how technology is used in archtecture and how it affects people. Some examples of how technology is used in archtecture are AR, Artifical intelegence, and BIM.
