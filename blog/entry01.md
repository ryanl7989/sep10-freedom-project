The topic I have decided on is Archtecture because my parents signed me and my brother up for a archeture camp and I liked it a lot and I want to learn more about it. My backup ideas were gambling and medicine because my dad owed a gambling school and I thought it was interesting and my parents want me to become a doctor. Some links that I used are https://www.autodesk.com/design-make/articles/technology-architecture
